## 🚀 About Me

Full Stack Developer with a hybrid and versatile profile thanks to my dual background in Multiplatform Application Development (DAM) and Network Computer Systems Administration (ASIR).

I have hands-on experience in:

- Backend with Java (Spring Boot) and Python applied to Computer Vision (YOLO/Ultralytics).
- Modern Frontend with React, TypeScript, and JavaScript.
- Automation, deployments, and systems administration in Linux environments.

My international experience in Ireland and my 24/7 customer support background have provided me with great adaptability, autonomy, and strong communication skills.

**I am looking for challenges in web development, automation (RPA), or full-stack projects where I can add value from day one.**
